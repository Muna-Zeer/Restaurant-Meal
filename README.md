# Restaurant Meal
This simple Website allows users to order meals from a restaurant menu, track the sum of their orders and modify their orders if needed. The simple Website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6).

## Features:
* The main page displays a list of restaurant meals, each with a name and price.

* When a user clicks on a meal card, a prompt appears, asking for the number of quantities for that order.

* After the user enters the number of quantities, the border of the meal card changes to green, indicating that the order has been made.

* The total amount of the orders is displayed in a shopping cart icon and updated in real-time as the user adds or modifies their orders.

* The simple Website also has another page (add.html) that displays all the orders made by the user, including the name of the order, the price multiplied by the amount, and the total sum of all orders.

* The user can delete any order and the summation will be modified accordingly. At the same time, the amount will be reduced in the shopping cart icon.

* All the data is stored in the local storage, so the user's orders persist even after refreshing the page.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.

2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
